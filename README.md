# Protist_Fungi_metaT
The Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) database is often used to annotate environmental sequence data; however, this databse does not contain references for a key group of marine protists, the MArine STramenopiles (MAST). Additionally, there is only one fungal group included in the MMETSP in its current form. Here, we show how to incorporate MAST SAGs and fungal reference genomes into a EUKulele database (https://eukulele.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This database can then be used to annotate environmental sequence data.

<br>
This repository will require the use of [TransDecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder) and [EUKulele](https://github.com/AlexanderLabWHOI/EUKulele).


## Download SAGs and fungal reference genomes
SAG data were obtained from Labarre et al. (2021); https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-00885-8
<br>
[Access the MAST SAG data here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Co-assembly/12430790?backTo=/collections/Comparative_genomics_reveals_new_functional_insights_in_uncultured_MAST_species/5008046)
<br>
<br>
Fungal reference genomes can be obtained from the MycoCosm database. All 8 references listed under the "Marine Fungi" category were included.

## Run TransDecoder on all assemblies to obtain protein sequences (.pep files)
```
./TransDecoder-TransDecoder-v5.7.1/TransDecoder.LongOrfs -t Assembly.fasta
```
## Add Source ID to all .pep file headers
The SourceID needs to be in the header line (i.e., line containig '>') of each contig in each assembly. The SourceID you include here will need to match a taxonomy file that we will create next. 
```
sed 's/>.*/& \/SOURCE_ID=NameOfOrganism/â€˜ Assembly.pep > AssemblyNew.pep
```
## Concatenate all protein files together
Each .pep file here corresponds to a different reference transcriptome that is being added to the MMETSP.
```
cat AssemblyNew.pep AssemblyNew2.pep AssemblyNew3.pep > all_assemblies.pep
```
## Make taxonomy table
Make a taxonomy table that is in the same format as the EUKulele taxonomy table. Example:
